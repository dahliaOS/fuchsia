# Fuchsia Workstation Releases
 
The first few releases here will be stock Fuchsia, with no addons or modifications. Keep in mind that these images are *incredibly* experimental, and may not work as intended. If you download and use these releases, please file an issue with us to report your hardware configuration, issues you encountered, and whether or not Workstation actually worked for you.

There currently is no set in stone release schedule for these releases.
